# Cioco's Homepage
My personal homepage, with bookmarks for websites that I was frequently visiting at the time of upload, a clock and a Google search bar. 

*To see the page you can access this [link](https://ciocolici.github.io/Cioco-s-Homepage/).*

*This is a project I created using the following assets:
- [Background](https://wallpaperswide.com/wow_cataclysm_worgen-wallpapers.html) (upscaled x4)
- [Icon](https://icon-icons.com/icon/home-circle/137496) (changed to white)
- [Font](https://www.dafont.com/shadow-of-the-deads.font)*

If the authors of any of these assets are unhappy with my use, I humbly request them to ask me to remove them, and I will happily comply.

This project has been made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, by someone who is aspiring to become a real programmer someday, and it is inspired by the work of my awesome [trainer](https://github.com/EvilWeasel/PersonalHomepage).
